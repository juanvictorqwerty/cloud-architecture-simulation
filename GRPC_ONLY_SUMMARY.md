# gRPC-Only Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Major Changes Completed**

### 1. **Removed All FTP Logic**
- ❌ Deleted `node_ftp_handler.py` and `router_ftp_handler.py`
- ❌ Removed all FTP imports and dependencies
- ❌ Removed `pyftplib` from requirements.txt
- ❌ Removed FTP server initialization from nodes and router
- ❌ Removed FTP port configurations from config.py

### 2. **Added Link Checking to Send Function**
- ✅ Send function now checks `LinksManager.is_transfer_allowed()`
- ✅ Transfer denied if nodes are not in the same link
- ✅ Proper error message when transfer is blocked by link rules

### 3. **Pure gRPC Communication**
- ✅ All file transfers use gRPC only (no FTP fallback)
- ✅ Upload, send, and download functions use gRPC exclusively
- ✅ Router forwards files via gRPC
- ✅ Node registration/unregistration via gRPC

### 4. **Simplified Architecture**
- ✅ Removed FTP port parameters from VirtualNode constructor
- ✅ Cleaned up config.py to only include gRPC ports
- ✅ Simplified router manager (no FTP server)
- ✅ Streamlined virtual network class

## 🔧 **Updated Port Configuration**
```
Router gRPC:    8000
Node1 gRPC:     8001
Node2 gRPC:     8002  
Node3 gRPC:     8003
Node4 gRPC:     8004
Cloud1 gRPC:    8011
Cloud2 gRPC:    8012
Cloud3 gRPC:    8013
Socket Server:  9999 (legacy compatibility)
```

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### Start the System:
```bash
# 1. Start router
python router.py

# 2. Start cloud nodes  
python cloud1.py
python cloud2.py
python cloud3.py

# 3. Start regular nodes
python node1.py
python node2.py
```

### Test Link-Aware Transfers:
```bash
# In node1:
touch testfile.txt 5
upload testfile.txt           # Uploads to all 3 clouds (no link restriction)

# Try to send to node2 (will check if they're in same link):
send testfile.txt node2       # Success/failure depends on link configuration

# If nodes are not linked:
# "Error: Transfer denied. Nodes node1 and node2 are not in the same link."
```

## 🔗 **Link Management Integration**
- Send function now uses `LinksManager.is_transfer_allowed(source, target)`
- Upload to clouds is always allowed (clouds not subject to link restrictions)
- Download from clouds is always allowed
- Node-to-node transfers respect link topology

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**
1. **Simplified Codebase**: Removed ~500+ lines of FTP-related code
2. **Better Performance**: gRPC is faster and more efficient than FTP
3. **Link Awareness**: Transfers respect network topology
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Single protocol for all communication
5. **Better Error Handling**: More specific error messages
6. **Easier Maintenance**: No dual-protocol complexity

## 🧪 **Testing**
- All nodes start with gRPC servers on ports 8000-8013
- Link checking works for send operations
- Upload/download operations work correctly
- Router properly forwards files between nodes
- Error messages are clear and informative

The system is now a pure gRPC implementation with proper link checking and no FTP dependencies!
