# Router Chunk Transfer Visualization

## âœ… **Implementation Complete**

The router now shows detailed chunk transfer progress for all file operations. Here's what was added:

### **ðŸš€ Transfer Start Notification**
```
ðŸš€ Starting transfer: largefile.txt (10.0MB) node1 â†’ cloud1
```
- Shows when a new transfer session begins
- Displays file size and transfer direction
- Includes unique transfer session ID in logs

### **ðŸ“¦ Chunk Progress Display**
```
ðŸ“¦ largefile.txt: 5/20 chunks (25%)
ðŸ“¦ largefile.txt: 10/20 chunks (50%)
ðŸ“¦ largefile.txt: 15/20 chunks (75%)
ðŸ“¦ largefile.txt: 20/20 chunks (100%)
```
- Updates every 5 chunks (configurable)
- Shows current/total chunks and percentage
- Always displays final chunk completion

### **âœ“ Transfer Completion**
```
âœ“ largefile.txt (10.0MB) received from node1
```
- Confirms successful file reconstruction
- Shows final file size
- Indicates source node

### **ðŸ”„ Forwarding Operations**
```
ðŸ”„ Forwarding largefile.txt (10.0MB) to cloud1
```
- Shows when router forwards files to target nodes
- Displays file size and destination
- Tracks multi-hop transfers

## ðŸ“Š **Detailed Logging**

### **Router Log File (Comprehensive):**
```
INFO - ðŸš€ Transfer started: largefile.txt (10.00MB) from node1 â†’ cloud1 [ID: a1b2c3d4]
INFO - Chunk 1/20 (512.0KB) received for largefile.txt from node1 â†’ cloud1 [5.0%]
INFO - Chunk 2/20 (512.0KB) received for largefile.txt from node1 â†’ cloud1 [10.0%]
...
INFO - Chunk 20/20 (512.0KB) received for largefile.txt from node1 â†’ cloud1 [100.0%]
INFO - âœ“ File largefile.txt (10.00MB) fully received from node1 in 20 chunks
INFO - ðŸ”„ Forwarding largefile.txt (10.00MB) from node1 to cloud1
INFO - Forwarded largefile.txt from node1 to cloud1: âœ“ largefile.txt sent to cloud1
```

### **Router Console (Clean):**
```
âœ“ Router gRPC server started on port 8000
âœ“ Router socket server started on port 9999
ðŸš€ Starting transfer: largefile.txt (10.0MB) node1 â†’ cloud1
ðŸ“¦ largefile.txt: 5/20 chunks (25%)
ðŸ“¦ largefile.txt: 10/20 chunks (50%)
ðŸ“¦ largefile.txt: 15/20 chunks (75%)
ðŸ“¦ largefile.txt: 20/20 chunks (100%)
âœ“ largefile.txt (10.0MB) received from node1
ðŸ”„ Forwarding largefile.txt (10.0MB) to cloud1
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### **Chunk Progress Logic:**
```python
# Show progress every 5 chunks or on final chunk
if request.chunk_number % 5 == 0 or request.chunk_number == request.total_chunks:
    print(f"ðŸ“¦ {request.filename}: {request.chunk_number}/{request.total_chunks} chunks ({progress_percent:.0f}%)")
```

### **Transfer Session Tracking:**
- Each transfer gets unique UUID
- Progress tracked per session
- Chunk data stored until complete
- Automatic cleanup after completion

### **File Size Calculations:**
- Chunk sizes shown in KB
- File sizes shown in MB
- Progress percentage calculated in real-time
- Bandwidth simulation maintains realistic timing

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits**

### **For Network Administrators:**
- **Real-time monitoring** - See transfers as they happen
- **Progress tracking** - Know how much is complete
- **Performance insights** - Chunk sizes and timing
- **Error detection** - Failed chunks immediately visible
- **Capacity planning** - Transfer patterns and sizes

### **For Debugging:**
- **Session tracking** - Unique IDs for each transfer
- **Chunk-level detail** - Individual chunk success/failure
- **Timing information** - Transfer start/completion times
- **Routing visibility** - See forwarding operations
- **Size validation** - Verify file integrity

## ðŸ“ˆ **Example Transfer Scenarios**

### **Upload to Multiple Clouds:**
```
ðŸš€ Starting transfer: document.pdf (2.5MB) node1 â†’ cloud1
ðŸ“¦ document.pdf: 5/5 chunks (100%)
âœ“ document.pdf (2.5MB) received from node1
ðŸš€ Starting transfer: document.pdf (2.5MB) node1 â†’ cloud2
ðŸ“¦ document.pdf: 5/5 chunks (100%)
âœ“ document.pdf (2.5MB) received from node1
ðŸš€ Starting transfer: document.pdf (2.5MB) node1 â†’ cloud3
ðŸ“¦ document.pdf: 5/5 chunks (100%)
âœ“ document.pdf (2.5MB) received from node1
```

### **Node-to-Node Transfer:**
```
ðŸš€ Starting transfer: data.zip (15.0MB) node1 â†’ router
ðŸ“¦ data.zip: 5/30 chunks (17%)
ðŸ“¦ data.zip: 10/30 chunks (33%)
ðŸ“¦ data.zip: 15/30 chunks (50%)
ðŸ“¦ data.zip: 20/30 chunks (67%)
ðŸ“¦ data.zip: 25/30 chunks (83%)
ðŸ“¦ data.zip: 30/30 chunks (100%)
âœ“ data.zip (15.0MB) received from node1
ðŸ”„ Forwarding data.zip (15.0MB) to node2
```

The router now provides comprehensive visibility into all chunk-level file transfer operations!
